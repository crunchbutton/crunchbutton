	<h4>How do I order food?</h4>
	<p>Easy! Just go to <a href="http://crunchbutton.com" target="_blank">crunchbutton.com</a> and click the restaurant you want to order from. Add whatever food you want, and enter your address, phone, and payment info. Click "Get Food" and try to stay hungry! The restaurant will call you when they're outside.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<h4>Is it cheaper for me to just call the restaurant?</h4>
	<p>Nope! Crunchbutton is totally free to you. Prices are the same as calling the restaurant. Sometimes even cheaper!</p>
	<br /><br />
	<h4>Is it faster for me to just call the restaurant?</h4>
	<p>Nope! With Crunchbutton ordering is as fast as a single click!! And we make sure our restaurants receive orders promptlier and accuratelier than when you call.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<h4>How do you save my info?</h4>
	<p>We use a super secure system away from our web server to store and encrypt all your financial information.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<h4>How do I change my stored info?</h4>
	<p>Just click on the info you want to change, enter the changes, and, after you place your order, it’ll be saved for next time.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<h4>But I've never used Crunchbutton before...</h4>
	<p>Oh man, it's okay. I remember my first time, it didn't last more than 30 seconds. I went to Crunchbutton.com, found my favorite restaurant, hit "Get Food." Minutes later, my sandwich arrived. Post-coital bliss ensued, that sandwich sure knew how to crunch my buttons.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<h4>omg i am wayy too drunk to enter my information</h4>
	<p>We thought this might happen. Luckily, Crunchbutton saves your address, phone, and payment info, so all you have to do is click what you want and hit the big, red "Get Food" button. Try to be awake when the delivery guy calls.</p>
	<br /><br />
	<h4>I want to put a restaurant on Crunchbutton.</h4>
	<p>Good idea! <a ng-click="navigation.link('/owners','push')">Get more info and contact us.</a></p>
