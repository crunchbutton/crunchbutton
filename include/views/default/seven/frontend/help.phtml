		<h4>How do I order food?</h4>
		<p>Easy! Just go to <a href="http://crunchbutton.com" target="_system">crunchbutton.com</a> and click the restaurant you want to order from. Add whatever food you want, and enter your address, phone, and payment info. Click "Place Order" and try to stay hungry! The driver will call you when they're outside.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="two-col">
		<h4>How do you save my info?</h4>
		<p>We use SSL and a PCI-DSS Level 1 Compliant provider to encrypt your information when you place an order. We never store any of your financial information on our web servers.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="two-col">
		<h4>How do I change my stored info?</h4>
		<p>Just click on the info you want to change, enter the changes, and, after you place your order, it’ll be saved for next time.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="two-col">
		<h4>But I've never used Crunchbutton before...</h4>
		<p>Oh man, it's okay. I remember my first time, it didn't last more than 30 seconds. I went to Crunchbutton.com, found my favorite restaurant, hit "Place Order." Minutes later, my sandwich arrived. Post-coital bliss ensued, that sandwich sure knew how to crunch my buttons.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="two-col">
		<h4>omg i am wayy too drunk to enter my information</h4>
		<p>We thought this might happen. Luckily, Crunchbutton saves your address, phone, and payment info, so all you have to do is click what you want and hit the big, red "Place Order" button. Try to be awake when the delivery guy calls.</p>
