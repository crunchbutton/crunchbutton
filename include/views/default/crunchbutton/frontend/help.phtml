	<p>
		<b>How do I order food?</b><br />
		Easy! First go to crunchbutton.com or use our <a href="http://crunchbutton.com/app">iOS/Android</a> apps. Click the restaurant you want to order from. Add whatever food you want, and enter your address, phone, and payment info. Click "Place Order" and enjoy your fleeting moments of hunger! Your driver will update their progress online and call when they're outside.<br /><br />
		<b>But I've never used Crunchbutton before...</b><br />
Hey, it's okay. I remember my first time. It lasted less than 30 seconds. I went to Crunchbutton.com, found my favorite restaurant, and hit "Place Order." Minutes later, my sandwich arrived. Post-mastication bliss ensued; that sandwich sure knew how to crunch my buttons.
		<br /><br />
		<b>How do you save my info?</b><br />
		We never store any of your financial information on our web servers. We use SSL and a PCI-DSS Level 1 Compliant provider to encrypt your information when you first place an order.
		<br /><br />
		<b>How do I change my stored info?</b><br />
		Just click on the info you want to change, enter the changes, and, after you place your order, itâ€™ll be saved for next time.
		<br /><br />
				<b>omg i am wayyy too drunk for this</b><br />
				We thought this might happen. Luckily, Crunchbutton saves your address, phone, and payment info, so all you have to do is click what you want and hit the big, red "Place Order" button. Try to be awake when the delivery guy calls. Watching <a href="http://www.leekspin.com/">www.leekspin.com</a> can help.
