$faq[] = [ 'q' => "What does a week in the life of a Crunchbutton community manager look like?",
'a' => "Our managers typically spend about 10-15 hours a week working on marketing. These hours are split between a number of responsibilities which include scheduling marketing meetings and events for ;your brand reps, serving as an intermediary between the drivers and Crunchbutton headquarters, weekly calls with your in office marketing director, and running around campus getting students excited about Crunchbutton!"];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "What is a brand rep?",
'a' => "A brand rep is a student that helps you brainstorm and market. They are your NUMBER ONE asset. Every community that we launch at is too large for one person to market alone, so your brand reps help you out."];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "How much do brand reps make?",
'a' => "Brand reps are paid per activation. This means that every time a new Crunchbutton user enters that brand rep’s promo code into the notes section, the rep makes $7 and the customer gets $3 off their first order."];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "The brand rep position sounds awesome and I have friends who would be super interested, how do I get them involved?",

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "How much do I make?",

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "How does payment work? ",
'a' => "We work on a profit share basis and pay via direct deposit. In order to get paid, please download the CM independent contractor agreement as well as your payment information on the Documents tab. Then resubmit them in cockpit.la"];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "My brand reps have promo codes that give customers $3 off their first order, what can I use to get people the same deal?",
'a' => "Our managers have 6 different promo codes that they can use: grubbz, yummy, crunchy, nomnom, feast, and orange. For all of these make sure you note what marketing you are doing with them and how much you’re doing.<br>
Ex: Promo code grubbz was used to put up 400 flyers in the freshman dorms."];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "What kind of marketing has worked will in the past?",
'a' => "Flyering, tabling, posting on social media, and word of mouth!"];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "What is the best way to flyer?",
'a' => "The goal of flyering is for as many people as possible to see the Crunchbutton name. So you should flyer in as many places as possible including lecture halls, library bathroom stalls, dorms and apartment buildings!."];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "Where do I get flyers?",
'a' => "Your in office marketing director should keep you well stocked in marketing supplies, but if you ever run out <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/sh/trk2i7wl4234z3j/AADmDMzJC4nKWrDbHOsUX46ya?dl=0' target='_system'>download</a> the follow templates and use them as flyers until you get more."];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "What does a good social media post look like?",
'a' => "A wise Dwight Schrute once said: K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid). The best social media posts are short and to the point. However, you should always include three things: our hours of operations, 2 or 3 popular restaurants, and a link to our website <a href='http://www.crunchbutton.com'>crunchbutton.com</a>."];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "How does word of mouth marketing work?",
'a' => "The best way to generate buzz about Crunchbutton is through your friends! Use your connections to get into club meetings, fraternity/sorority chapter meetings, and an article about us in the paper. It doesn’t cost anything to reach out to friends and they’re normally always down to help! "];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "My friends love Crunchbutton, but are disappointed with the restaurant choices, what do I do?",
'a' => "Easy! Email us at <a href='mailto:marketing@crunchbutton.com'>marketing@crunchbutton.com</a> with the name of the restaurant and we’ll get started on that!"];

$faq[] = [ 'q' => "Is this the only marketing I can do?!",
'a' => "HECK NO! They sky is the limit! Use your creativity, be zany, be funny, build community."];
