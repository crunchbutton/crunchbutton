		<b>Payment:</b><br>
		At the end of each week, you will be reimbursed for your credit/debit card spendings plus what you earned. You get to keep all cash received from cash orders. If there are discrepancies between what you paid for the order versus what the customer was charged (not including taxes, delivery fee, etc), email team@crunchbutton.com so we can fix prices online.
