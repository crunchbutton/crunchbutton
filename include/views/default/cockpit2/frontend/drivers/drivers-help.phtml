						Sooooo, how does this work?
					</b>
					<br>
					Customers place orders for food on our website and app. When an order arrives during your shift, you'll get a text on your phone linking you to the order page right here on cockpit.la. You’ll see the details for each order - customer name, phone, and address; the restaurant name and address; and the order contents.You’ll pick up the food and deliver it. We aim for delivery times under 45 minutes. Simple enough, right?
					<br><br>

					<b>
						How do I activate my PEX card?
					</b>
					<br>
					Click <a href="/drivers/docs/pexcard">Activate PEX Card</a>. Follow the instructions. Please do this at least 2 hours before your first shift. You’ll be told on each order page whether to use your PEX card for that order. A PEX card is similar to a pre-paid debit card and Crunchbutton adds to the balance of the card just for orders where you should use it.
					<br><br>
					<b>
						How should I prepare for my shift?

					</b>
					<br>
					Make sure your phone is fully charged, and you have enough gas. All of the restaurants are centrally located around the college campus you’re serving, so head to the restaurant district and wait for orders to come in.
					<br><br>

					<b>
						How do I respond to customer texts?
					</b>
					<br>
					Customers may text you directly, but texts may also be routed to you through our customer service line. In that case, you just have to start your message with the number at the beginning of the customer's text message. So if the customer texts "<strong>@127651 #258745 Christy Customer: Can you get extra mustard</strong>" then you text her back by saying "<strong>@127651 Absolutely!</strong>"
					<br><br>

					<b>
						Will there be other drivers on shift with me?
					</b>
					<br>
					That depends on order volume in your community. We try to make sure drivers have enough orders to stay busy and make money, without being overwhelmed with too many. You can find out who’s scheduled by clicking <a href="/drivers/shifts">Shifts</a> in the menu. It’s great to be in touch with other drivers on shift to divvy up orders and make sure everyone is happy.
					<br><br>
					<b>
						Ok, how do I make sure I’m not picking up another driver’s order?

					</b>
					<br>
					Mark your orders as Accepted as soon as you get them, which ensures another driver won’t pick it up. Then mark them as Picked Up and Delivered at the appropriate times. This allows us to more intelligently route orders, which significantly increases your potential revenue. We also track delivery times--you want to go as fast as safely possible to delight the customer!
					<br><br>
					<b>
						Where do I park at the restaurant?
					</b>
					<br>
					As you get more experience, you'll learn the best parking spots for each restaurant. Restaurants will also often have a reserved space out front or around the corner. If a restaurant has a tricky parking situation, make a note about it in cockpit.la to alert other drivers for next time.

					<br><br>
					<b>
						What do I do at the restaurant?
					</b>
					<br>
					Some restaurants have formal arrangements with Crunchbutton, so the food will be paid for and prepared and you just pick it up. At other restaurants you buy the food yourself, as if you were the customer. The order page on cockpit.la will tell you which is the case for each restaurant. Double-check the order contents so you don't have to go back for missing items. If you need to buy the food yourself, use the Crunchbutton PexCard, except when the order says that the customer is paying cash - in that case, you should use your own money.
					<br><br>

					<b>
						Wait, cash?
					</b>
					<br>
					Yup, be sure to carry cash while on shift! A small amount of customers pay with cash, so try to have $20 in small bills with you. You’ll keep the cash the customer pays with, so you essentially get an immediate advance of earnings that would otherwise be paid to you in your next regular electronic payment.<br><br>
					<b>
						I’ve run out of money for a cash order! What do I do?!

					</b>
					<br>
					If you run out of funds, you can either 1) ask another driver on shift to take that order; or 2) use the PEX card. If you need to use the PEX card, make sure to email <a target="_system" href="mailto:payment@crunchbutton.com">payment@crunchbutton.com</a> the order number and the amount you paid so we can adjust payments accordingly.<br><br>

					<b>
						What should I tell the restaurant?

					</b>
					<br>
					In many cases we don't have a formal relationship with the restaurant, and it's best not to cause confusion. So order the food yourself, and don't mention that it's for delivery. If the order was sent directly to the restaurant, then say you're there to pick up the takeout order under the customer's name. If they point out that there's no name on the card, tell them it's a "company card" and everything will be fine.<br><br>

					<b>
						What if the order price is wrong?

					</b>
					<br>
					We'll tell you how much the food should cost. If the prices in store differ from what we tell you, plz let us know! Just email your receipt, the order number, and a pic of the menu to <a target="_system" href="mailto:payment@crunchbutton.com">payment@crunchbutton.com</a>. 1 in 3 menu updates will earn you a random $ amount bonus ;)<br><br>
					<b>
						What if the customer doesn’t show up?
					</b>
					<br>

					Hang onto the food, text the customer and leave a friendly voicemail. Then go on to your next order, and hopefully the customer will respond soon! Meanwhile, let us know too, by text.

					<br><br>

					<b>Help, I need to contact the customer and/or restaurant!</b><br>

					Within each order on Cockpit, there is a phone number next to both the customer and restaurant's name. Tapping that number will put you straight into a call or text with the customer or restaurant.<br><br>

					<b>How do I get from the restaurant to the customer?</b><br>

					Within each order, we've embedded GPS directions from Point A (the restaurant) to Point B (the customer). Just click on the map, and off you go!

					<br><br>

					<b>Any pointers on how to deliver food well?</b><br>
					Of course! Remember that aside from the food, we are selling our customers an experience. Always try to look clean and fresh in both clothing and appearance, and when delivering in person, remember to deliver their food in person to the door in a friendly demeanor (do not make them walk towards you in your car, we don't want drivers to be seen as being lazy!). When transporting customers' food, remember to carry the food and drinks securely, so nothing spills and everything arrives in perfect condition for the customer.

					<b>
						How can I get tipped more on cash orders?
					</b>
					<br>
					Easy! When a customer asks you how much the order is, say “[the order total], <i>not including tip</i>” and flash them your best smile!<br>
					Customer: Oh! Hello kind driver. Hurray my food, how much is it??<br>
					You: $25.67, <i>not including tip</i>. (flashing your best smile!)<br>
					Customer: Ok, here, have a million dollars, keep the change.<br>
					You: K thx bye.<br><br>

					<b>
						Provide good service!

					</b>
					<br>
					Maintain good communication between you and your customer and shoot them an apologetic text if their food is going to be delayed! "Hey, [RestaurantName] is really backed up today so it'll be a little longer than the delivery estimate. Really sorry about that! I'll be there with your food as soon as humanly possible!"
					<br><br>

					<b>
						How do I pick up food faster at the restaurant?
					</b>
					<br>
					For restaurants where we don’t send the order directly to the restaurant, you’re told to “place the order yourself.” Do this faster by placing the order on the restaurant’s app! These chains have apps in most locations—Chipotle, Taco Bell, Panda Express, Chik Fil A, Subway.

					<br><br>

					<b>How do I deliver more orders faster and make more money?</b><br>
					Pick up multiple orders at once, then deliver them all at once. This allows you to deliver more orders in the same period of time and make more money.
					<br><br>

					Why this works: Restaurants are usually close together. And customers are usually close together. So first visit a bunch of restaurants, then deliver to a bunch of customers. We aim for delivery times under 45 minutes, so do whatever is most efficient!<br><br>

					<b>
						How do I use my invite code and how do I earn extra $$$ with it?

					</b><br>
					Your Personal Invite Code: <strong>{{account.user.invite_code}}</strong>. Find NEW customers by promoting Crunchbutton on your own and getting them to enter this code in the Notes section of their first order. Each NEW person you refer will receive $3.00 off their first order, and you'll earn $7.00 when they order! Your code will only work for a customer's FIRST order.

					<br><br>
					<b>
						How do I tell which menu item toppings are default and which are additions?

					</b><br>

					Any default options are listed under the item name.<br>
					Any default options the customer has requested removed will say "NO" before the option.<br>
					Any non-default "additional" options will say "ADD" before the option.<br><br>
					<b>
						3 great ways to use your invite code:
					</b><br>

					1. Talk to everyone you can about how awesome Crunchbutton is.<br>
					2. Post your code on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram/YikYak, etc.<br>
					3. Hand out cards with your code on them to everyone you can.<br><br>

					We pay by direct deposit. Click <a href="/drivers/docs">Documents</a> and make sure your forms are all uploaded to get paid properly.<br><br>

					<b>
						When do I get my $$$?
					</b><br>
					Payments are usually received every Friday for the previous Mon-Sun week. For example: If your first week is Monday, June 1 - Sunday, June 7, your first payment will be on Friday, June 12.

						What are Flex vs Perma-Shifts?

					</b><br>
					You'll work either the same days every week (perma-shifts) or different days each week (flex shifts). In either case, you can view your shifts any time on cockpit. Email us at <a target="_system" href="mailto:drivers@crunchbutton.com">drivers@crunchbutton.com</a> to set up perma-shifts.<br><br>

					<b>
						How do Flex Shifts work?

					</b><br>
					Your shift preferences are due by Monday at 5pm. Click “Shift Preferences” to the right to submit them. You’ll be texted on Wed at 10 AM Pacific with the results, and you’ll be see them in <a href="/drivers/shifts">Shifts</a> too!<br><br>

					<b>
						I want to work more shifts. What do I do?

					</b><br>
					Email us at <a  target="_system" href="mailto:drivers@crunchbutton.com">drivers@crunchbutton.com</a>. You can also text other drivers and offer to drive for them—you can find the other drivers in your community and their numbers on the <a href="/drivers/shifts">Shifts</a> page. If you ever see an unfilled current or upcoming shift on the <a href="/drivers/shifts">Shifts</a> page, you can text us at <a ng-click="callText('646-783-1444')">646-783-1444</a> to snag it!
					<br><br>

					<b>
						I can’t drive one of my upcoming shifts. What should I do?

					</b><br>
					First, contact other drivers from <a href="/drivers/shifts">Shifts</a> to ask if someone can trade with you. Then text us to let us know about the trade.<br><br>

					If you absolutely can’t find anyone yourself, it's important you give us at least 2 days notice if you can't make a shift you're scheduled for. We put a lot of faith in our independent drivers to honor their scheduled shifts. Otherwise we might have to shut down the community, which leads to sad customers and other drivers potentially not being able to work! And you may incur a $10 deduction from your fees.<br><br>

					<b>
						Can I drive if I'm not scheduled for a shift?

					</b><br>
					You can still drive if you’re not scheduled for a shift! Cockpit will route orders to scheduled drivers first, and if they’re not accepted within 5 minutes, unscheduled drivers will be able to accept them. During peak hours (usually ~6-9pm) or when only one driver is scheduled, unscheduled drivers may be able to get lots of orders.<br><br>
