	Hey <?php echo $name; ?>,
</p>
<p>
	Here's your username to log in when orders come in.

	Username: <?php echo $login ?>
	<br/>
	Password: (is the one you typed)
</p>
<p>
	Test this URL out on your phone (exactly as it appears, no www.) <a href="<?php echo $url; ?>">cockpit.la/<?php echo $id_order; ?></a>. Play around with it and make sure you understand how everything works.
</p>
<p>
	If you have any questions, just text us directly at 646-783-1444.
</p>
<p>
	Once you've tested it, let me know, to confirm that it worked.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks,<br />
	The Crunchbutton Team
