  3. Take a screenshot of it if there's anything written there.
    - To take a screenshot for Mac of just one area: shift + command + control + 4. This will copy it to your clipboard. Hit command + v into the ticket/issue and the picture will show up. 
    - To take a screenshot for Windows: Use the snipping tool and drag the picture into the issue/ticket. OR alt + PrtScnSysRq.     - Then drag that into the ticket/issue and the picture will show up.

*If a developer has a question on an issue you created, please make sure to respond ASAP, or it might be closed and not addressed properly.*

**It is always better to provide too much information than too little.**
