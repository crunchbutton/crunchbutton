To report development issues, please make sure you provide as much information as possible to help identify the problem.

**For user/Crunchbutton related issues**

1. Browser
2. Operating system or Mobile device
3. Specific page and info enterd on that page
4. User name, phone, and order
5. A detailed account of what happened in order

**For admin/Cockpit related issues**

1. Browser
2. Operating System or mobile device
3. Specific page and info enterd on that page

If a developer has a question, please make sure to respond ASAP, or it will just get closed and not addressed properly.

**It is always better to provide too much information than too little.**
